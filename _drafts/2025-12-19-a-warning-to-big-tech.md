## This is not a threat. It is a prediction.

Large AI platforms now sit in a position no technology has ever occupied before.

They do not merely host content.
They do not merely recommend media.
They actively observe **how humans think**, over time, in private, at depth.

And yet they systematically refuse to do one obvious thing:

> Help humans find other humans.

## The missing feature

No major AI system ever says:

> “You should talk to this person.”

Not for:
- dating
- collaboration
- learning
- support
- friendship
- problem-solving

This absence is not accidental.

Human-to-human connection is the one feature that would:
- reduce dependence on the AI
- shorten sessions
- enable off-platform relationships
- weaken lock-in

So it is quietly omitted.

## Loneliness is not a side effect anymore

We are now in a world where:
- people talk daily to AI
- but struggle to find real humans to talk to
- despite living in the most connected era in history

Dating apps are shallow.
Professional networks are performative.
Forums are adversarial or dead.

AI platforms could help.
They choose not to.

At scale, this is no longer neutral.
It is an ethical failure produced by incentives.

## Data portability changes the game

Every major platform is legally required to let users export their data.

This includes:
- prompts
- conversations
- interaction history
- preferences
- embeddings (directly or indirectly)

Individually, this data is inert.

Collectively, it is a **social graph waiting to exist**.

If platforms refuse to act in users’ interests, users will act for themselves.

This is not sabotage.
It is exit.

## The inevitable outcome

If AI companies do not build:
- privacy-preserving
- opt-in
- low-volume
- non-explanatory
human-to-human recommendation systems

Then others will.

Decentralized.
Federated.
User-owned.
Messy at first.
Better over time.

And once users experience:
> “This system helps me meet people who matter”

they will not go back.

---

## This is the warning

Not moral outrage.
Not regulation.
Not protest.

Just competition enabled by data rights.

The choice is simple:

- Either AI platforms become bridges between humans
- Or they become hoarders of lonely minds

History is clear about which side wins.
